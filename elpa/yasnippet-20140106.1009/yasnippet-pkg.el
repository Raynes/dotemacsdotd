(define-package "yasnippet" "20140106.1009" "Yet another snippet extension for Emacs." 'nil ";;; Commentary:\n;;\n;;   Basic steps to setup:\n;;\n;;    (add-to-list 'load-path\n;;                 \"~/path-to-yasnippet\")\n;;    (require 'yasnippet)\n;;    (yas-global-mode 1)\n;;\n;;\n;;   Interesting variables are:\n;;\n;;       `yas-snippet-dirs'\n;;\n;;           The directory where user-created snippets are to be\n;;           stored.  Can also be a list of directories.  In that case,\n;;           when used for bulk (re)loading of snippets (at startup or\n;;           via `yas-reload-all'), directories appearing earlier in\n;;           the list shadow other dir's snippets.  Also, the first\n;;           directory is taken as the default for storing the user's\n;;           new snippets.\n;;\n;;           The deprecated `yas/root-directory' aliases this variable\n;;           for backward-compatibility.\n;;\n;;\n;;   Major commands are:\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-expand\n;;\n;;           Try to expand snippets before point.  In `yas-minor-mode',\n;;           this is normally bound to TAB, but you can customize it in\n;;           `yas-minor-mode-map'.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-load-directory\n;;\n;;           Prompts you for a directory hierarchy of snippets to load.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-activate-extra-mode\n;;\n;;           Prompts you for an extra mode to add snippets for in the\n;;           current buffer.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-insert-snippet\n;;\n;;           Prompts you for possible snippet expansion if that is\n;;           possible according to buffer-local and snippet-local\n;;           expansion conditions.  With prefix argument, ignore these\n;;           conditions.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-visit-snippet-file\n;;\n;;           Prompts you for possible snippet expansions like\n;;           `yas-insert-snippet', but instead of expanding it, takes\n;;           you directly to the snippet definition's file, if it\n;;           exists.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-new-snippet\n;;\n;;           Lets you create a new snippet file in the correct\n;;           subdirectory of `yas-snippet-dirs', according to the\n;;           active major mode.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-load-snippet-buffer\n;;\n;;           When editing a snippet, this loads the snippet.  This is\n;;           bound to \"C-c C-c\" while in the `snippet-mode' editing\n;;           mode.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-tryout-snippet\n;;\n;;           When editing a snippet, this opens a new empty buffer,\n;;           sets it to the appropriate major mode and inserts the\n;;           snippet there, so you can see what it looks like.  This is\n;;           bound to \"C-c C-t\" while in `snippet-mode'.\n;;\n;;       M-x yas-describe-tables\n;;\n;;           Lists known snippets in a separate buffer.  User is\n;;           prompted as to whether only the currently active tables\n;;           are to be displayed, or all the tables for all major\n;;           modes.\n;;\n;;   If you have `dropdown-list' installed, you can optionally use it\n;;   as the preferred \"prompting method\", putting in your .emacs file,\n;;   for example:\n;;\n;;       (require 'dropdown-list)\n;;       (setq yas-prompt-functions '(yas-dropdown-prompt\n;;                                    yas-ido-prompt\n;;                                    yas-completing-prompt))\n;;\n;;   Also check out the customization group\n;;\n;;        M-x customize-group RET yasnippet RET\n;;\n;;   If you use the customization group to set variables\n;;   `yas-snippet-dirs' or `yas-global-mode', make sure the path to\n;;   \"yasnippet.el\" is present in the `load-path' *before* the\n;;   `custom-set-variables' is executed in your .emacs file.\n;;\n;;   For more information and detailed usage, refer to the project page:\n;;      http://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet\n\n")
